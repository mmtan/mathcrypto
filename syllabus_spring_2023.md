## Course Description:

In this course, students will learn about basic number theory and abstract algebra necessary to understand the definitional details of modern number-theoretic encryption schemes. All of the mathematical developments in this course are directly motivated by cryptographic applications.
 
Learning Outcomes: After taking this course, you will

- Learn the fundamental concepts of number theory and abstract algebra needed for modern number-theoretic encryption schemes.
- Learn to derive properties/theorems needed for modern number-theoretic encryption schemes.
- Gain exposure to the modern number-theoretic encryption schemes and their underlying assumptions.
- Learn to formulate and understand the security properties given by the encryption schemes.

## Class 

 Class will be conducted in face-to-face mode. Whether a given class is provided face-to-face in a traditional classroom environment, or online via WebEx or TEAMs, you are expected to attend. I expect you to be in class. I recognize the need to miss classes due to unforeseen circumstances. Missing class will miss content. You will need to make an effort to keep current on the material.
 
**Note** The course delivery methodology may change at some point during the semester based on future CDC Georgia Department of Health guidelines. We may be forced to go temporarily or completely online to satisfy future health safety requirements. In the event this occurs, procedures outlined in the syllabus will be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the modified class environment.

Last Day of withdrawal: TBA
Final Exam : THURS MAY 11 2-3 PM 

## Homework and Exams

As listed above in the grading section, there will be homework. You can discuss the homework with your classmates. Depending on the size of the class,  you might be asked to form a group of 1-3 students. You should turn in only one write-up for your entire group. 
The homework will consist questions that require solving problems by writing concrete mathematics proof and writing small programming programs.
Questions in homework may be discussed during the tutorial sessions. 
Exams are written exams. Students will be asked to solve problems similar to homework problems. The exams will be an open book exam. Printed materials, textbooks, and handwritten notes are allowed. Calculators are allowed . Phones, laptops, tablets , and other electronic devices are not allowed.

## Missed Exams

No make-up exams will be allowed. In case of a documented excuse, the weight of the missed exam be placed onto the final’s weight. 

## Academic Accommodations

Augusta University will make reasonable academic accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students should contact Testing and Disability Services (Galloway Hall; 706.737.1469; www.augusta.edu/tds/) as soon as possible for more information and/or to initiate the process for accessing academic accommodations.
“Augusta University believes academically qualified individuals with disabilities should have equal opportunity and access to a quality education. We are actively involved in fostering an environment that encourages full participation by students with disabilities in every segment of the University.
The Office of Disability Services was established to help ensure an accessible and positive college experience for students with disabilities. Our Office [Testing and Disability Services] provides a variety of services and accommodations to meet the needs of disability related concerns in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Board of Regents' policies”   [https://www.augusta.edu/tds/disabilityservices.php](https://www.augusta.edu/tds/disabilityservices.php)

## Distracting Behavior

Distracting behavior such as uninvited casual talk among students, use of cell phones, snoring, or inappropriate behavior toward fellow students or faculty will not be tolerated. Faculty have the right and the responsibility to maintain a classroom free of such distractions. Students who persist in such behavior may be asked to leave the class and may be counted absent for the session. Persistent disruptive behavior may result in forced withdrawal from the course.

## Academic Honesty

In an academic community, honesty and integrity must prevail if the work done and the honors awarded are to receive their respect. The erosion of honesty is the academic community’s ultimate loss. The responsibility for the practice and preservation of honesty must be equally assumed by all of its members. Any type of dishonesty in securing those credentials therefore invites serious sanctions, up to and including, a “WF” or “F” in the course, and expulsion from the institution.  Please reference the [http://catalog.augusta.edu/content.php?catoid=27&navoid=3332&hl=honesty&returnto=search#Academic_Honesty](http://catalog.augusta.edu/content.php?catoid=27&navoid=3332&hl=honesty&returnto=search#Academic_Honesty) for further details and specific definitions of cheating and plagiarism.
“Augusta University (“AU”) recognizes that academic honesty is essential to its academic function. The [AU academic honesty policy] following regulations protect the equity and validity of the University’s grades and degrees, and help students develop ethical standards and attitudes appropriate to academic and professional life. Violations of academic honesty include, but are not limited to, cheating of all kinds, plagiarism, research misconduct, collusion, and false statements made to avoid negative academic consequences.” *- from the AU Academic Honesty policy which can be found in the AU Policy Library at* [https://www.augusta.edu/compliance/policyinfo/policies.php](https://www.augusta.edu/compliance/policyinfo/policies.php)
 
Academic standards and procedures can also be found in the AU Student Manual (section 5 – 2018/19 Manual) - which can be found on the AU Student life website at [https://www.augusta.edu/student-affairs/](https://www.augusta.edu/student-affairs/)

Unethical behavior of students in any form is not acceptable and will not be tolerated in the School for Computer and Cyber Sciences. Academic dishonesty – to include cheating on exams, plagiarism of the work of others, unapproved collaboration on graded work, and the like - will be dealt with immediately and with clear consequences. Depending on the nature and severity of the problem, a student who is guilty of any such violation may be: 1) withdrawn from the course with a grade of WF (counted as an F in the GPA); 2) given a grade of zero on the assignment; 3) given a grade of F in the course; or 4) otherwise penalized, at the discretion of the faculty member. Two occurrences of a WF grade for academic dishonesty can result in a student’s being expelled from the University, per current University policy as described in the University Catalog. - HCB Professional Behavior Guidelines

## Library Resources

Augusta University has a designation as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education. Please be aware that students and faculty have no-additional-fee access to subscription-based on-line CD journals, books, and other publications. The Library’s Cyber Resource Center is at [http://guides.augusta.edu/friendly.php?s=cyber](http://guides.augusta.edu/friendly.php?s=cyber). 

## Campus Carry Law

House Bill 280, commonly known as the “campus carry” legislation, is effective as of July 1, 2017. Below is a link to the guidelines developed by the Office of Legal Affairs for the implementation of House Bill 280 that must be followed on all University System campuses.
