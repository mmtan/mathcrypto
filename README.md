Course Description:
In this course, students will learn about basic number theory and abstract algebra necessary to understand the definitional details of modern number-theoretic encryption schemes. All of the mathematical developments in this course are directly motivated by cryptographic applications.
 
Learning Outcomes: After taking this course, you will
- Learn the fundamental concepts of number theory and abstract algebra needed for modern number-theoretic encryption schemes.
- Learn to derive properties/theorems needed for modern number-theoretic encryption schemes.
- Gain exposure to the modern number-theoretic encryption schemes and their underlying assumptions.
- Learn to formulate and understand the security properties given by the encryption schemes.
